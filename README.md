## 🗓 Calendar

- [`blockFromPersonalCalendar.gs`](blockFromPersonalCalendar.gs): takes events from a calendar (pressumably personal), and blocks the times in which there are events in another one (pressumably professional)
- [`clearPastBlocks.gs`](clearPastBlocks.gs): looks at past events that are named in specific ways (see, for example [`blockFromPersonalCalendar.gs`](blockFromPersonalCalendar.gs)), and deletes them
